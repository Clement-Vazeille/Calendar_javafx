# calendrier
My first java project
Made on intellij with the javafx library

it isactuallyworking for the current month
Just need to make switching month possible
the goal is that by pressing left or right button the scene will switch to the previous/next month

For the moment there are two files, a main one that do almost everything and another one that handle date genration
